# Contributor Guide

This repository is being prepared for a community-distributable OpenSolar
package. `AGENTS.md` is a contributor-facing guide for coding agents and
maintainers working in this repo. It is not an installed runtime artifact.

## Source of Truth

- For public contributors, use the current issue/request, verified git state,
  `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, and the tracked docs as the source of truth.
- If task notes conflict with verified repository facts, record the mismatch in
  the current task handoff and stop only when the conflict blocks the current
  task.

## Scope

- This migration is packaging work, not a rewrite.
- Keep `core/` TypeScript, `harness/` Python, and skill internals unchanged
  unless the migration plan explicitly names the edit.
- Solar's shipped runtime remains a Claude Code overlay. Do not introduce
  product behavior that assumes this coding agent is the runtime engine.
- Optional bridges and experimental integrations stay component-gated and off
  by default unless the plan says otherwise.

## Compatibility Modules

The public extraction omitted a few modules that the daemon imports. The
following are minimal compatibility implementations, provisionally ratified
and pending the upstream originals:

- `core/daemon/skill-dispatcher.ts` — resolves installed `SKILL.md` files;
  fails loudly on missing skills.
- `core/orchestrator/` (`index.ts`, `types.ts`, `retry-policy.ts`) —
  single-node graph construction/execution, events, retry policy, and the
  control surfaces the daemon calls.
- `core/config/privacy.ts` — env-backed contact/identity config with neutral
  fallbacks and no personal data.

Rules for these files: keep each header marker intact, do not extend their
behavior beyond what the daemon needs to boot and serve, and expect a future
change to replace them wholesale with upstream originals.

## Local Workflow

- Work on `pkg/migration` unless the user asks for a different branch.
- Local commits are allowed when a scoped task has been verified.
- Do not push branches, tags, or commits without explicit user approval.
- Keep scratch notes, private plans, and local task records out of public commits
  unless the user explicitly asks to publish them.
- One task should map to one commit. Use workstream-prefixed messages such as
  `WS1: repair package manifest`.

## Safety Rules

- Never touch the real `$HOME` during install or uninstall tests. Use a sandbox
  home such as `HOME=$(mktemp -d)`.
- Do not run destructive git operations or history rewrites without explicit
  user approval.
- Before committing, inspect `git status` and stage only files changed for the
  current task.
- Before committing new or modified files, run the repository privacy scan
  described in the migration plan and fix any newly introduced matches.

## Verification

- Prefer automated checks over judgment calls.
- Record meaningful command results and gate status in the current task handoff.
- If a required check cannot run, record the reason and keep the task marked as
  unverified until the missing check is addressed.
