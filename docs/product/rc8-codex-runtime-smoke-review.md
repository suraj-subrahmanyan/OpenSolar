HEAD `cd528d0a`. The branch has a passing isolated Codex-only smoke E2E, plus
deterministic contract tests for the runtime fixes that led up to it.

## 2. Deterministic Test History

The deterministic checks below passed before the live E2E was accepted.

### Model Registry Contract

Codex/OpenAI aliases were registered in `harness/config/model-registry.json`.
The following model-registry CLI checks passed:

```bash
python3 harness/lib/model_registry.py --registry harness/config/model-registry.json validate-main gpt-5.5
python3 harness/lib/model_registry.py --registry harness/config/model-registry.json validate-main gpt-5.3-codex-spark
python3 harness/lib/model_registry.py --registry harness/config/model-registry.json provider gpt-5.5
python3 harness/lib/model_registry.py --registry harness/config/model-registry.json model-key gpt-5.3-codex-spark
python3 harness/lib/model_registry.py --registry harness/config/model-registry.json validate-main opus
python3 harness/lib/model_registry.py --registry harness/config/model-registry.json validate-main claude
python3 harness/lib/model_registry.py --registry harness/config/model-registry.json validate-main anthropic-sonnet
python3 harness/lib/model_registry.py --registry harness/config/model-registry.json validate-main anthropic-opus
```

Current expected Claude alias failures were preserved for `sonnet`,
`sonnet-4`, and `opus-4`.

### Focused Runtime Tests

The following compile and pytest checks passed on the integration branch before
the final live E2E:

```bash
python3 -m py_compile \
  harness/lib/graph_scheduler.py \
  harness/lib/graph_node_dispatcher.py \
  harness/lib/route_proof.py

python3 -m pytest -q \
  harness/tests/graph/test_graph_status_sync.py \
  harness/tests/graph/test_graph_dispatch_submit.py \
  harness/tests/runtime/test_graph_node_dispatcher_patch_proof.py \
  harness/tests/runtime/test_route_proof.py \
  harness/tests/test_pm_dispatch.py \
  harness/tests/runtime/test_codex_operator_contract.py
```

Result: `75 passed, 3 warnings`. The warnings were existing
`datetime.utcnow()` deprecation warnings in runtime helper code.

Coverage included:

- repair lifecycle tests:
  - active repair does not let stale failed `node_results` terminalize dependencies
  - failed parent status reopens when graph has active repair/re-eval work
  - repaired handoff schedules fresh evaluator dispatch with repair generation metadata
- graph patch-proof tests:
  - `patch_diff exists` without a `field` triggers patch proof
  - `output_present` with `field=patch_diff` is honored
  - patch proof presence is true only when a real non-empty patch file exists
- route-proof tests:
  - OpenAI-only proof passes
  - non-OpenAI provider violation is detected
- PM dispatch tests:
  - implementation capsule test-authoring aliases are canonicalized
  - provider-policy route behavior stays fail-closed
- Codex operator contract tests:
  - command construction and output/result path contracts remain stable

## 3. Live E2E Evidence

Run command:

- Preserved bundle: `/tmp/RC8-CODEX-ONLY-LIVE-E2E-CD528D0A-PASS-20260701-202854`
- Final status: `passed`
- Final phase: `finalized`
- Final task graph status: `passed`
- Poll result: status reached `passed` at poll 23
- Worktree status after run: clean
- Current-run process residue after teardown delay: clean for `/tmp/solar-live-codex-e2e.mNglEl`

## 4. Scope Statement

This smoke proves:

- Codex-only PM -> Planner -> Builder -> Evaluator smoke path.
- OpenAI-only fail-closed route proof for this smoke.
- Node patch-proof sidecar generation.
- Basic artifact and evidence closeout.

This smoke does not yet prove:

- Claude-only runtime.
- Setup wizard or installer.
- Windows WSL fresh install.
- macOS fresh install.
- Deep research or live web research.
- AutoSci.
- Long report generation.
- Repair lifecycle in live E2E, although deterministic repair tests pass.

## 5. Known Risks

- Older unrelated `/tmp/solar-live-codex-e2e.*` coordinator/watchdog leftovers
  were observed on the host from previous runs. The current passing run cleaned
  up after teardown delay, but cleanup hygiene should be handled separately.
- `route-proof.json` should receive a product-release review before declaring
  provider routing fully release-gated.
- The setup wizard branch is separate from this runtime integration branch.
- The server-side setup gate is still separate.
- The direct browser dashboard path may bypass the Electron preload gate until
  the server-side gate is added.

## 6. Recommended Next Steps

1. Push `integration/rc8-runtime-mode-contract` for review after approval.
2. Do cleanup hygiene in a separate patch.
3. Run Claude-only equivalent or fail-closed proof.
4. Run a realistic AI4Research prompt after branch review.
5. Integrate the setup wizard later through a separate integration branch.
