"""Regression: a finalized sprint is terminal and frozen (Defect C).

A post-close graph scan must not reopen a closed sprint:
  * `_reconcile_existing_dispatches` must early-return when `.finalized` exists, so a
    lingering per-node handoff file cannot "repair" (revert) a node back to reviewing.
  * `_graph_terminally_closed` recognizes a closed graph so the coverage refresh keeps
    `.finalized` sticky instead of stripping it on a stale non-PASS coverage verdict.

Observed bug: after a clean close+finalize, a reconcile reset S2 passed->reviewing from
its leftover handoff file and the coverage refresh stripped `.finalized`, reopening the
sprint ~90s later.
