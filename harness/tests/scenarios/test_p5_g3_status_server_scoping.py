"""G3 run-2 fix-round: status-server lifecycle must be scoped to ITS harness.

G3 live rung 2 (run-archive/p5-g3-live-rung-20260709T190808Z,
RUN_SETUP_FAILED_NO_INTAKE): the sandbox status server answered /healthz at
19:09:53Z and refused connections by 19:10:14Z — killed silently, empty
stderr. Root cause is in `solar-harness.sh status-server stop`: it probes
ports 8765-8775 for ANY /healthz responder and lsof-kills EVERY listener on
those ports, machine-wide, plus it kills a fixed global tmux session name.
With parallel harness sessions on one machine (the standing situation), any
session's stop/restart kills every other session's status server — the
contamination/cleanup failure class landing inside the P5 campaign.

These tests run the REAL solar-harness.sh with HARNESS_DIR pointed at a tmp
harness (line 17 makes it env-respecting) and pin the scoping contract:

- a foreign /healthz listener in the swept port range SURVIVES this
  harness's stop;
- this harness's own server (pidfile-recorded, or args matching
  $HARNESS_DIR/lib/symphony/status-server.py) is still killed;
- start does not adopt a foreign listener as "already running".
