"""G3 run-11 proof-anchor fix-round — F-CLASS-16 tail in the PROOF layer.

Run 11 (run-archive/p5-g3-live-rung-20260710T011720Z-crashrecovery, sprint
sprint-20260710-011912-intent-build-a-small-command-line-u-6df32ed7):
certified-generic builders execute with work_dir = sprints/<sid>/workdir and
wrote REAL artifacts (workdir/workspace/wordfreq.py, tests/, test_report.md;
pytest cache proves the tests ran). The gate ledger shows the same shape for
S1, S2 and S3: evaluator PASS content -> gate_check policy block
proof_obligations_failed -> evaluator re-records FAIL quoting the manifest.

Root cause (archived S1/S2/S3 manifests: roots {}, rows exists=false, while
the secret-leak guard scanned the SAME files under the workdir): the node
artifact manifest was written with base_dir=HARNESS_DIR and roots={} — the
planner-authored generic graph carries no artifact_roots map — so every
declared workspace/... output resolved to a nonexistent HARNESS_DIR path,
the manifest override flipped the presence map to false, and the proof gate
failed work that existed.

Fix under test: graph_node_dispatcher anchors the manifest for
CERTIFIED-GENERIC sprints at the sprint workdir with the contract's
canonical root (workspace/), normalizing the contract's alias spellings
(sprints/<sid>/workdir/..., workdir/...) onto it — the same principle as
the run-5 gate-cwd fix in contract_gate_executor (commit 519755a6 /
5c0ed562). Fixed contracts keep the HARNESS_DIR anchor and graph-carried
roots byte-identical (P2/P3 proven) — pinned below. Genuinely missing
outputs still fail the gate — pinned below.
