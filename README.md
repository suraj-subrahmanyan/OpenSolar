# OpenJiuwen Solar

OpenJiuwen Solar is a Python/bash harness for running a Claude Code based
multi-agent software cockpit. It opens real `claude` processes in tmux panes,
accepts natural-language work, records the work as file-backed sprint/runtime
artifacts, dispatches to live agents, and keeps human approval gates in the
loop.

Solar is not a finished autonomous cloud service and not a TypeScript
orchestrator product. The working product today is the local harness plus the
installer/lifecycle tooling around it.

## Quick Start

Shell installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suraj-subrahmanyan/OpenSolar/stable/get-solar.sh | bash -s -- --yes --components kernel,harness
~/.solar/bin/solar doctor
```

Python wrapper from the current release branch:

```bash
pipx install "git+https://github.com/suraj-subrahmanyan/OpenSolar.git@stable#subdirectory=distribution/pipx"
openjiuwen-solar install --yes --components kernel,harness
openjiuwen-solar doctor
```

After the owner publishes the prepared PyPI package, the wrapper install command
becomes:

```bash
pipx install openjiuwen-solar
openjiuwen-solar install --yes --components kernel,harness
```

Interactive install is also supported:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suraj-subrahmanyan/OpenSolar/stable/get-solar.sh | bash
```

The installer writes only under `~/.solar` and `~/.claude/solar`, records an
install receipt, and gives you `solar doctor`, `solar update`, `solar repair`,
`solar backup`, and `solar uninstall`.

## What You Get

The real, working Solar surface is:

- a four-pane tmux cockpit through `solar harness start`;
- natural-language intake through `solar harness intake "..."`;
- live dispatch to Claude Code panes when Claude auth, trust, and quota are
  available on the machine;
- human gates such as `solar harness plan-verdict` and
  `solar harness eval-verdict`;
- per-role model selection through `solar harness models show` and related
  `models` verbs;
- background tasks through `solar harness bg`;
- program analytics through `solar harness stats`;
- cross-machine migration/deploy helpers through `solar harness migrate` and
  `solar harness deploy`;
- deterministic local status views through `solar status`, `solar doctor`, and
  `solar ui`;
- optional knowledge integrations such as the Obsidian wiki and RAGFlow
  adapters.

Some code in `core/` is roadmap scaffolding or compatibility glue. It is kept in
the repository, but the README and CLI surfaces should not treat it as a fully
working autonomous orchestrator.

## Language Policy

Solar v1.0 ships with a Chinese-first persona and English lifecycle commands.
Commands, docs, installer output, and public-facing help are being made English
first. The operative kernel/persona content still contains Chinese by design;
full bilingual kernel translation is post-v1.0 work.

## Platform Support

| Platform | v1.0 status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | Primary | Main target for the tmux/Claude cockpit. Bash 4+, tmux, jq, Python 3, git, and Claude Code are needed for live harness work. |
| Linux | Supported | Installer/lifecycle and deterministic smoke are covered in CI. Live Claude behavior still depends on local Claude Code auth/trust/quota. |
| Windows / WSL2 | Deferred / untested for v1.0 | `install.ps1` exists as a WSL2 bootstrapper, but the full Windows hardware path is owner-manual and not part of the current support claim. |

## Basic Workflow

Verify the install:

```bash
solar status
solar doctor
```

Check the harness launch requirements:

```bash
solar harness preflight
```

Start the Product Delivery cockpit:

```bash
solar harness start /path/to/project
```

Inside the cockpit, trust/login prompts and Claude quota limits are real
operator boundaries. Solar can show deterministic plumbing status, but it cannot
prove live Claude work until the panes actually produce a real response/result
on your machine.

Submit a task:

```bash
solar harness intake "Add a failing test for the parser bug, fix it, and show the evidence."
```

Approve or reject gates:

```bash
solar harness plan-verdict <sprint-id> approve "scope looks right"
solar harness eval-verdict <sprint-id> pass "tests and evidence accepted"
```

Choose or inspect models:

```bash
solar harness models show
solar harness models set-main opus --apply
```

## Install Details

See:

- [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for components, flags, install layout, and lifecycle
  commands.
- [docs/FIRST-SESSION.md](docs/FIRST-SESSION.md) for the first install,
  cockpit, intake, and model-selection walkthrough.
- [docs/COMPONENTS.md](docs/COMPONENTS.md) for the generated component list.
- [docs/UNINSTALL.md](docs/UNINSTALL.md) for residue-free uninstall behavior.
- [docs/WINDOWS.md](docs/WINDOWS.md) for the deferred WSL2 bootstrap path.

Default install:

```bash
./install.sh --yes --components kernel,harness
```

Optional components include `core-runtime`, `skills-md`, `skills-office`,
`skills-obsidian`, `skills-calendar`, `skills-browser`, `codex-bridge`,
`mempalace`, `daemons`, and `solar-max`. Use:

```bash
./install.sh --list-components
```

## Development And Release

This repository is still being prepared for public v1.0 packaging. Do not treat
local branches, release candidates, or the moving `stable` branch as registry
publication. The owner performs irreversible release actions: PyPI upload,
GitHub Release creation, release asset upload, tags, and public ref updates.

Contributors should read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before editing. Release
preparation remains owner-gated and uses the maintainer checklist in this repo.
